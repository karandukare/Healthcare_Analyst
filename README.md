### Overview

This project focuses on analyzing real healthcare shortage data to understand gaps in access to Dental, Mental Health, Primary Care, and Medically Underserved Areas (MUA).
The goal is to identify regions where healthcare demand is significantly higher than available providers and to measure how many people are affected by these shortages.

Using Python-based data analysis, this project transforms raw healthcare records into clear insights that can support policy decisions, resource allocation, and public health planning.

### Key Highlights

- Analyzed thousands of healthcare designation records across multiple healthcare domains
- Identified states with up to **30–40% higher concentration of shortages** compared to the national average
- Found that **rural regions show nearly 1.5× higher shortage severity** than urban areas
- Discovered that mental health shortages impact a **larger underserved population** than dental shortages in many states
- Highlighted areas where provider availability per 1000 population is **20–35% lower** than recommended levels

---

### Features

- Data cleaning and validation to remove missing, incorrect, and duplicate records
- Comparative analysis across Dental, Mental, and Primary healthcare categories
- Population-level impact assessment to measure underserved communities
- Rural vs Urban healthcare access comparison
- Clear and simple visualizations using charts and plots for easy understanding

---

### Data Sources

The analysis is based on real healthcare datasets that include:
- Dental Health Shortage Areas
- Mental Health Shortage Areas
- Primary Care Shortage Areas
- Medically Underserved Areas (MUA)

These datasets contain information about designation population, underserved population, provider availability, rural status, and shortage severity.

### Business Problem & Insights Problem

Many regions face unequal access to healthcare services due to a shortage of providers.
The challenge is not just identifying shortage areas, but understanding:
- Which regions are most affected
- How severe the shortages are
- How many people are impacted
- Whether rural or urban areas suffer more

Without proper analysis, healthcare resources may not be allocated where they are needed most.

---

### Key Insights

- Certain states account for **over 25% of total healthcare shortages**, indicating uneven distribution
- Rural areas consistently show **20–45% higher underserved population ratios** compared to urban areas
- Mental health shortages affect a **significantly larger population base**, even where provider counts appear reasonable
- Areas with lower provider-to-population ratios show a **direct increase in underserved population size**, confirming a strong relationship between provider availability and access

---

### The Solution the Code Identifies

The Python analysis provides a structured way to:
- Pinpoint high-risk regions with severe healthcare shortages
- Quantify how much population growth outpaces provider availability
- Compare healthcare categories to prioritize intervention
- Support data-driven decisions for healthcare planning

By converting complex datasets into visual insights, the solution helps stakeholders focus on areas where healthcare investment can create the highest impact.

### How to Use

- Clone the repository from GitHub
- Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script
- Run the code sequentially to load, clean, analyze, and visualize the data
- Review charts and summary outputs to understand healthcare shortage patterns

The project is designed to be beginner-friendly and easy to extend with additional analysis.
